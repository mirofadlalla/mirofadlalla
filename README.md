## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a highly driven **AI Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI**. I started my journey in **web development** (Laravel, Node.js) and gradually transitioned into **AI & Machine Learning**, where I now focus on building **scalable, production‑ready intelligent systems**.

I have hands‑on experience across the **entire AI lifecycle** — from data exploration and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. I enjoy working on **real‑world problems**, transforming raw data into actionable insights, and delivering AI solutions that actually work in production.
